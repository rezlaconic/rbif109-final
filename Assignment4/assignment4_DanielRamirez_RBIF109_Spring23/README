Script for RBIF-109 Assignment 4 : Homolog Finder

Script will accept a peptide sequence either in the form of a string or FASTA file and conduct a BLASTP search to 
gather multiple sequence homologs. Homologs will be binned by percent similarity and 96 homologs across all bins will 
be chosen and exported to a ready-to-order csv.

Expected Usage:

python3 homolog_finder.py --fasta tdt.fasta

Expected Inputs ( Only 1 required):
--fasta : path to a fasta file containing amino acid sequence
--aa_sequence  : string of amino acid sequence 

Expected Outputs:

1) 96-well-homologs.csv - CSV assortment of 96-homologs 

2) blast_alignments.txt - TXT file  containing the formatted alignments from the BLASTP query

3) blast_results.csv - CSV file containing the analyzed BLASTP records

4) blast_summary.png - PNG Plots describing the spread of percent similarity of homologs obtained
